# Portfolio-Week2

# # 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Our Task

Our task was to create our own portfolio page and display our completed projects so far. We would also consistently update the portfolio as we completed more and more projects and we learnt more about the course. Because it was a an even week that meant we had to write the code from scratch, this was the first time I have ever really had to do that and I intially struggled but once I did my own research and got in the habit of making them I found it to be quite straight forward.

As seen above in the mockup, we needed to follow a similar structure to the example portfolio. A big thing for me wasn't to make it pretty but more the website worked, I decided to draw what I wanted it to look like so i had a template to follow. See screenshot below

Firstly I decided to use more photos in the about me section rather then just a lot of writing but also i think it allows the site to have a lot more potential to grow and develop, although it seems very basic on the outside i believe this will allow me to edit the structure of the website better when we have to continually add to it over the course. PLus I think pictures are better for someone to understand me rather then a few sentences

Please see the screenshot below

Once I had the flow of the page set up to section them off to left and right, I decided to fix my nav bar and get my links working.

Please see the screenshot below

From there we had to make one image bigger then the other items so I decided to split these into 2 sections but keep the children classes the same so that way they still looked the same. I also wasnt sure what to links to put as my smaller icons as I didnt have anything to link it to, so I put the weather in and my favourite footy team, I will be looking to change this once I have a few more projects done and I can add them to my page, you will see a screenshot attached of different size images and also hover link to take you to those websites.

Lastly we needed to make sure out website was a responsive layout and could adjust to multiple viewports, as per example i was able to get the boxes to stack when the site shrinks

After I completed all that, I fixed up a few things I didnt like but overall I am happy with how the functionality works and I can build on the CSS as I go along further in the course
