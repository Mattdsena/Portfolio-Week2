# Portfolio-Week2

# # 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Our Task

Our task was to create our own portfolio page and display our completed projects so far. We would also consistently update the portfolio as we completed more and more projects and we learnt more about the course. Because it was a an even week that meant we had to write the code from scratch, this was the first time I have ever really had to do that and I intially struggled but once I did my own research and got in the habit of making them I found it to be quite straight forward.
