# Portfolio-Week2

# # 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Our Task

Our task was to create our own portfolio page and display our completed projects so far. We would also consistently update the portfolio as we completed more and more projects and we learnt more about the course. Because it was a an even week that meant we had to write the code from scratch, this was the first time I have ever really had to do that and I intially struggled but once I did my own research and got in the habit of making them I found it to be quite straight forward.

As seen above in the mockup, we needed to follow a similar structure to the example portfolio. A big thing for me wasn't to make it pretty but more the website worked, I decided 

Firstly I decided to use more photos in the about me section rather then just a lot of writing but also i think it allows the site to have a lot more potential to grow and develop, although it seems very basic on the outside i believe this will allow me to edit the structure of the website better when we have to continually add to it over the course.
